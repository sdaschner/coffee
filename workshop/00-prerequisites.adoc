== Prerequisites

As prerequisites to perform the workshop, you need to have the following tools installed on your laptop:

- JDK 8+
- Maven 3
- Docker
- `kubectl`
- `helm` (Tiller not required)
- <<ibm-cloud-cli,IBM Cloud CLI>> (`ibmcloud`)
- `curl`
- on Windows, access to a Unix shell (Babun, Cygwin, etc.)


=== IBM Cloud access

[[ibm-cloud-cli]]
==== Installing IBM Cloud CLI

Follow the steps listed under the https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/download_cli.html#shell_install[Install from shell^] section to download and install the IBM Cloud CLI.

- MacOS: `curl -fsSL https://clis.ng.bluemix.net/install/osx | sh`
- Linux: `curl -fsSL https://clis.ng.bluemix.net/install/linux | sh`
- Windows (Powershell): `iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://clis.ng.bluemix.net/install/powershell')`

==== Registering IBM Cloud Account

Open a browser window and navigate to https://cloud.ibm.com/registration.

image::images/registration.png[Registration page]

Fill in the registration form and follow the link in the validation email when it arrives.

image::images/email.png[Validation email]

https://console.bluemix.net/login[Login into IBM Cloud^] using the account credentials you have registered.

NOTE: New IBM Cloud accounts default to a https://www.ibm.com/cloud/pricing[new "`lite`" account version^].
This account type provides free access to a subset of IBM Cloud resources.


==== IBM Cloud CLI

We log into the IBM Cloud CLI tool: `ibmcloud login`.
If you have a federated account, include the `--sso` flag: `ibmcloud login --sso`.

Install the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service plug-in (`cs` sub command):

----
ibmcloud plugin install container-service
----

To verify that the plug-in is installed properly, run `ibmcloud plugin list`.
The Container Service plug-in is displayed in the results as `container-service/kubernetes-service`.

Initialize the Container Service plug-in and point the endpoint to your region:

----
ibmcloud cs region-set eu-gb
----

All subsequent CLI commands will operate in that region.


=== IBM Kubernetes Service

https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui[Create a Kubernetes cluster^] (lite or standard) using the https://cloud.ibm.com/containers-kubernetes/catalog/cluster/create[Cloud Console^] or CLI in region `eu-gb` (London).
A lite / free cluster is sufficient for this workshop but feel free to create a standard cluster with your desired configuration.

NOTE: When you're using the CLI or the browser Cloud console, always make sure you're viewing the correct region, as your resources will only be visible in its region.

NOTE: Lite clusters expire after one month.


==== Accessing the cluster

No, we'll see how to set the context to work with our clusters by using the `kubectl` CLI, access the Kubernetes dashboard, and gather basic information about our cluster.

We set the context for the cluster in the CLI.
Every time you log in to the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service CLI to work with the cluster, you must run these commands to set the path to the cluster's configuration file as a session variable.
The Kubernetes CLI uses this variable to find a local configuration file and certificates that are necessary to connect with the cluster in IBM Cloud.

List the available clusters: `ibmcloud cs clusters`.
This command should now show your cluster which is being created.

Download the configuration file and certificates for the cluster using the `cluster-config` command:

----
ibmcloud cs cluster-config <cluster-name>
----

Copy and paste the output command from the previous step to set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable and configure the CLI to run `kubectl` commands against the cluster:

----
export KUBECONFIG=/<home>/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/mycluster/kube-config-<region>-<cluster-name>.yml
----

Get basic information about the cluster and its worker nodes.
This information can help you managing the cluster and troubleshoot issues.

Get the details of your cluster: `ibmcloud cs cluster-get <cluster-name>`

Verify the nodes in the cluster:

----
ibmcloud cs workers <cluster-name>
kubectl get nodes
----

View the currently available services, deployments, and pods:

----
kubectl get svc,deploy,po --all-namespaces
----

==== Installing Istio

Now, we'll see how we download and install Istio 1.0.5 to our cluster.

We download Istio 1.0.5 directly from https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/1.0.5[GitHub^].
Choose the version that matches your system: `istio-1.0.5-<os>.{zip,tar.gz}`

We extract the installation files (example for `tar.gz`):

----
tar -xvzf istio-<istio-version>-linux.tar.gz
----

Optionally, we add the `istioctl` client to the PATH.
The `<version-number>` is in the directory name.

----
export PATH=$PWD/istio-<version-number>/bin:$PATH
----

We switch the directory into to the Istio file location: `cd istio-<version-number>` and we install Istio’s resource definitions via the following commands:

----
helm template $PWD/install/kubernetes/helm/istio --name istio --namespace istio-system \
  --set tracing.enabled=true \
  --set grafana.enabled=true \
  --set kiali.enabled=true \
  --set pilot.traceSampling=100.0 \
  > /tmp/istio.yaml
kubectl create namespace istio-system
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled --overwrite
kubectl create -f /tmp/istio.yaml
----

This will install Istio 1.0.5 with distributed tracing, Grafana monitoring, Kiali, and automatic sidecar injection for the `default` namespace being enabled.

Now, we ensure that the `istio-*` Kubernetes services have been deployed correctly.

----
kubectl get services -n istio-system
----

NOTE: For Lite clusters, the istio-ingressgateway service will be in `pending` state with no external IP address.
This is normal.

We ensure the corresponding pods `istio-citadel-*`, `istio-ingressgateway-*`, `istio-pilot-*`, and `istio-policy-*` are all in `Running` state before continuing.

----

Before we continue, we make sure all the pods are deployed and are either in `Running` or `Completed` state.
If they're still pending, we'll wait a few minutes to let the deployment finish.

Congratulations! We now successfully installed Istio into our cluster.


==== Container Registry

In order to build and distribute Docker images, we need a Docker registry.
We can use the IBM Container Registry which can be accessed right away from our Kubernetes cluster.

We log into the Container Registry service via the `ibmcloud` CLI and obtain the information about our registry:

----
ibmcloud plugin install container-registry
ibmcloud cr login
ibmcloud cr region-set eu-gb
ibmcloud cr region
You are targeting region 'uk-south', the registry is 'registry.eu-gb.bluemix.net'.
----

We use the CLI to create a unique namespace in the Container Registry service (`cr`) for our workshop:

----
ibmcloud cr namespace-add <your-name>-workshop
ibmcloud cr namespaces
----

In order to test our new registry namespace, we pull a public image, re-tag it for our own registry, for our region, and push it:

----
docker pull sdaschner/open-liberty:javaee8-tracing-b1
docker tag sdaschner/open-liberty:javaee8-tracing-b1 registry.eu-gb.bluemix.net/<your-name>-workshop/open-liberty:1
docker push registry.eu-gb.bluemix.net/<your-name>-workshop/open-liberty:1
----

Let's see whether our image is now in the private registry:

----
ibmcloud cr images
----

NOTE: In all following examples, you will need to adapt the image / namespace name!
This is important to take into consideration, otherwise the examples won't work since the images won't exist in your account.

=== Local Docker setup

If you want to try out the example locally, you have to create a Docker network similar to the following:

----
docker network create --subnet=192.168.42.0/24 dkrnet
----

Now, we've finished all preparations.
Let's get started with the link:01-introduction.adoc[workshop].
